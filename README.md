# FlightSim
A connection between a real aircraft cockpit and the FlightGear Flight Simulator.
This is a project created for the Arduino Due, if you need to PWM voltage's for a Mega, they are present at almost all PWM values.

The FlightSim is a project that I created for school. As stated above, it connects a physical cockpit with meters and input to the FlightSimulator. I created another repo for that as it is writen in C# (see https://github.com/GWillemsen/FlightGearSerialConnector for that project).
